                    I like to play video games competitively and for fun; games like Rainbow Six: Siege, Tekken, Counter-Strike, Starcraft and other difficult entries are more often than not competitive games with players that have been practicing (either within that game or within that genre of game) for years.

                    Single-player games are also immensely fun when tapping the right genres, between your typical survival-horror games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill to your action/adventure games like Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, and many many more.

                    I also like to play Ultimate Frisbee in my spare time, although I haven't had much time to play competitively between school and my recent work. The sport involves a sort of combination between football and rugby, with your active thrower unable to move as he or she tosses their disc to the end zone.

                    There are different types of throws you can utilize against opponents! Your typical backhand throw involves you curling your arm inwards and using a combo of your wrist and tricep. The strength of your throw highly depends on the flick of your wrist, so you can utilize this to throw a 'forehand' throw to your opposite side, or a 'tomahawk' throw above your head!

                    I didn't grow up building computers, but I sure grew up using them. I've had an interest in computers since I was a kid, and I've been fascinated by how they work and how they improve on a daily basis. I've been around them all my life, and honestly can't imagine myself in a job outside the computer world if I think about it hard enough.

                    I learned my way around computers through the hardware rather than the software first. I was too afraid to dig into a self-built computer on my first go, so I ended up buying a pre-built machine and gathering up the courage to dig into it later on in my years. Now I stand as a hungry and motivated scholar to the programming world, hype with the prospect of new hope.
